# Face Recognition
It is a system which is based on KNN algorithm and detects/identify the person in front of the camera.
A file record_faces is used to collect the user/person data of face and is used as the training data for the Machine Learning model to get trained.
Then this data is used upon by the testing code which uses KNN for prediction and gives the desired output.
